# COMPREHENSIVE WEBSITE AUDIT
## Centre for Regulatory Studies - World-Class Research Center Standards

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Mission**: Transform CRS website to compete with top global law schools and think tanks (Harvard, Oxford, Max Planck, Brookings, etc.)

**Current Status**: Strong foundation with excellent technical implementation, but missing critical elements that establish world-class credibility and engagement.

---

## 1. CRITICAL MISSING ELEMENTS

### A. IMPACT & CREDIBILITY MARKERS ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**What Top Institutions Have:**
- Impact metrics (citations, downloads, media coverage)
- Testimonials from policymakers/judges
- Awards and recognitions

- Policy impact stories
- Media mentions section

**CRS Currently Missing:**
- No quantifiable impact metrics

2. **For Students**: No admission process, no program brochure links
3. **For Researchers**: No collaboration opportunities
4. **For Media**: No media kit, no press contact
5. **For Donors**: No funding opportunities mentioned

**Top Institutions Have:**
- Newsletter signup (build mailing list)

**Missing:**
- Blog or commentary section
- Expert opinions on current events
- Podcast/video content
- Webinar series
- Policy briefs on trending issues
- Op-ed archive with prominence

**Stanford/Berkeley Model:**

## 2. CONTENT & MESSAGING ANALYSIS

### A. STRENGTHS ✅

1. **Strong Value Proposition**
   - "Building capacity to govern markets of tomorrow" - compelling
   - Clear interdisciplinary focus
   - Addresses national need

2. **Credible Heritage**
   - Founded by Dr. M.S. Sahoo (strong credential)
   - Parent institution (NLU Delhi) prominently featured
   - Established 2015 (credible history)

3. **Quality Publications**
   - Business Standard, Thomson Reuters - reputable outlets
   - Consistent publication track record
   - Diverse topics showing expertise

### B. WEAKNESSES ❌

1. **No Compelling Statistics**
   - "3 decades of reforms" mentioned but no numbers on CRS impact
   - No student enrollment figures
   - No research output metrics
   - No alumni placement data

2. **Limited Storytelling**
   - No narrative about specific policy victories
   - No case studies of regulatory impact
   - No student/alumni success stories
   - Missing "why this matters" human element

3. **Weak Differentiation**
   - What makes CRS unique vs. other NLUs?

**Issues:**
1. Hard to find specific information quickly
2. No search functionality
3. No breadcrumbs or wayfinding
4. Long scroll to reach courses/contact
5. Publications not organized by topic

**Best Practice** (MIT, Yale):
- Mega menu with sub-categories

- Quick links for key audiences
- Sticky navigation

**RECOMMENDATION**:
- Add search functionality
- Create "Quick Links" for key audiences (Students, Researchers, Policymakers)
- Add "Resources" dropdown with categorized content
- Consider multi-page structure for major sections

---

### B. CALLS-TO-ACTION (CTAs) ❌ **WEAK**

## CONCLUSION

**Current Status**:
The CRS website has EXCELLENT technical implementation - better than 80% of academic institutions. The foundation is solid.

**Gap**:
Missing the **content elements and engagement mechanisms** that transform a good website into a world-class thought leadership platform.

**The Difference Between Good and World-Class:**
- Good: "Here's what we do"
- World-Class: "Here's how we changed policy, here's our impact, here's how you can engage"

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Implement Phase 1 recommendations (Impact, CTAs, Newsletter)
2. Gather impact metrics and testimonials
3. Create content repository with downloads
4. Develop engagement framework for key audiences
5. Plan content calendar for ongoing updates

**Bottom Line:**
CRS has exceptional credentials and research output. The website needs to AMPLIFY this impact through strategic content, social proof, and clear engagement paths.

This is not about technical fixes anymore - **it's about strategic positioning and audience engagement**.
